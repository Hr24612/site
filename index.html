						Project Description:
					</h1>
					<h4>
						I have served as the President of Cardinal Space Mining Club, where
						I lead my team to NASAâ€™s Robotics Mining Competition 2019. The goal
						of the competition was to create a Martian mining robot that is
						responsible for excavating gravel under 12 inches of simulated
						Martian terrain. Over the year, I had the privilege of working with
						smart people who were passionate about what they were doing. I
						managed all the subsystem teams from mechanical to electrical. I was
						involved in the autonomous navigation of the robot through working
						with lasers and IR sensors for orientation tracking and obstacle
						detection. I also helped implement a telemetry system for
						localization through triangulation. This system enabled the robot to
						find its way to the mining area and back to the collection bin. At
						the competition, we stood 4th out of 46 college teams and this was
						possibly one of my biggest achievement at Iowa State.

					<h1>Ethics Essay</h1>
					<h4>
						The purpose of ethics is to Foster awareness of ethical issues.
						Promote ethical behavior among those working within IEEE fields of
						interest. Create a world in which engineers and scientists are
						respected for exemplary ethical behavior.
						<br />
						<br />
						Whenever I am faced with an ethical situation, I always think
						logically and keep my emotions under control. I always consider the
						best thing to do and try my best not to think of the potential
						outcomes since that might influence my decision making. I then try
						to do or say whatever is right and hope for the best.
						<br />
						<br />
						The ethical issues discussed in class were an ability to recognize
						ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering, function
						effectively in a team, use engineering judgment to conclude,
						communicate effectively and solutions that meet specified needs with
						consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as
						global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
						<br />
						<br />
						My ethical considerations are very similar to the ones discussed in
						class. I agree with all of them, and there were a few that I was not
						aware of, which I know now. The ethics have positively impacted me
						and will help me in my career by making me a better engineer,
						problem solver, and a team player.
						<br />
						<br />
						After my case study, the three most significant ethics, in my
						opinion, were, Honesty, Responsibility, and Charity. These are
						prevalent in my case study because they make the team more
						productive. The honesty part is essential since the team must be
						open about their knowledge so that work is assigned accordingly.
						Responsibility is paramount since the work assigned must be finished
						with the person's best abilities. Lastly, Charity is essential
						since, in a team, people must feel that their claims are trusted and
						respected. This ensures an environment where everyone feels included
						and relevant. Other ethics, as described in the 5P's are essential;
						however, the three discussed here, are more prevalent in the case
						study.
